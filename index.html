      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="para-two">I am Kevin, and as mentioned above, I am a big nerd. I am studying full stack web design with Angela Yu and I'm due to start a degree in Computing and IT with networking in the new year. I love to play video games and Dungeons and Dragons in
        my spare time and I'm an avid reader of supernatural and fantasy fiction.</p>

        <h3>Programming and Code</h3>
        <p class="">I have coded extensive scripts for mudlet using LUA and RegEx to assist with quality of life while playing MUD games using Mudlet. I have some basic experience with Python and JavaScript and at present some moderate HTML and CSS skills which I'm currently developing further. I will also be learning and developing further JS, MungoDB and Bootstrap in the very near future. </p>

        <h3 class="hobbies">Hobbies and Sports</h3>
        <p class="">I am an avid player of Dungeons and Dragons and our group meet at least once a week to further the campaigns we play in. The dungeon master changes with each new campaign with campaigns typically taking 10 months to a year. I also enjoy video games of all varieties and weather permitting I love to mountain bike cross-country in the Welsh valleys.</p>
